The whole code was timed to check how effective the code is to parallelization. It can be seen that for N = 1000, both Symbolic and AD by Hand take up as much time as Matrix-free method for N = 500. Although the Matrix-free method takes more time per iteration it requires fewer iterations to converge as when compared to the other two methods. It can also be noted that more time is spent per newton iteration which is dependent on the parameter "TOL_newton" set inside "params.in". We can hence increase this tolerance value such that the linear solver is stable and yet the time required per newton iteration is reduced thereby increasing the overall performance of the code.
For example when N = 500 , TOL_newton = 1e-6 and TOL_linsolve = 1e-7 , we get the time for the execution of the code as 279.220 [s] on average and when we use TOL_newton = 1e-3 and TOL_linsolve = 1e-7, we get the execution time as 155.364 [s] which is half the time compared to the previous case. For both these cases, we get the same apriori error measured in both l2-norm and max norm.
